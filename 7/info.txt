7. AES in ECB Mode

The Base64-encoded content at the following location:

https://gist.github.com/3132853

Has been encrypted via AES-128 in ECB mode under the key

"YELLOW SUBMARINE".

(I like "YELLOW SUBMARINE" because it's exactly 16 bytes long).

Decrypt it.

Easiest way:

Use OpenSSL::Cipher and give it AES-128-ECB as the cipher.
