14. Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption, Partial control version

Take your oracle function from #12. Now generate a random count of
random bytes and prepend this string to every plaintext. You are now
doing:

  AES-128-ECB(random-prefix || attacker-controlled || target-bytes, random-key)

Same goal: decrypt the target-bytes.

What's harder about doing this?

How would you overcome that obstacle? The hint is: you're using
all the tools you already have; no crazy math is required.

Think about the words "STIMULUS" and "RESPONSE".
