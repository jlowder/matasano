9. Implement PKCS#7 padding

Pad any block to a specific block length, by appending the number of
bytes of padding to the end of the block. For instance,

  "YELLOW SUBMARINE"

padded to 20 bytes would be:

  "YELLOW SUBMARINE\x04\x04\x04\x04"

The particulars of this algorithm are easy to find online.
