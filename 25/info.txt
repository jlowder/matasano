25. Break "random access read/write" AES CTR

Back to CTR. Encrypt the recovered plaintext from

     https://gist.github.com/3132853

(the ECB exercise) under CTR with a random key (for this exercise the
key should be unknown to you, but hold on to it).

Now, write the code that allows you to "seek" into the ciphertext,
decrypt, and re-encrypt with different plaintext. Expose this as a
function, like, "edit(ciphertext, key, offet, newtext)".

Imagine the "edit" function was exposed to attackers by means of an
API call that didn't reveal the key or the original plaintext; the
attacker has the ciphertext and controls the offset and "new text".

Recover the original plaintext.
