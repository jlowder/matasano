# Matasano

These were my solutions to the "original" matasano crypto challenges,
from around 2013. These challenges were originally email-only and
required to be kept private, but that has changed with the move to
[cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/).

I had decided to combine these challenges with learning a new
language, so I implemented them in racket.
